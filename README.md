A tool to help calculate fusions in Persona 3: FES, Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 and Persona 4 Golden.

# Changes

- Filter by case-insensitive regex (very basic -- does no error checking!)
    - This can, for example, allow you to write out a list of Personas you currently have summoned:

        `belial|nebiros|helel|attis|metatron`

      Not perfect as it'll match any fusion with _any_ persona matching, but it's a start.
